more details of us proposal: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0x0c12752d28a68fd3dc791826b3405b8803aa8a52/0x0c12752d28a68fd3dc791826b3405b8803aa8a52-0

A study regarding the adoption of DeFi IRL within LatAm is currently being carried out through the Arbitrum DAO and RnDAO CoLab Fellowship.

The study is still ongoing, however, the results at the moment show that a form of decentralized trust score is needed to encourage web3 people to support strangers over the internet with their money.

The team behind this proposal thinks that a fork of the Gitcoin Passport modified for stamps that IRL local businesses can claim would facilitate them getting a web3 credit.

Verifiable off-chain data will ease the path for more people to benefit from the potential that decentralized and regenerative finance can bring to local economies.
